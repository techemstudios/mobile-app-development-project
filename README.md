# Mobile App Development Project  

Useful exercise for understanding how to start creating a mobile app for any OS. All work must be uploaded to this repository.  

## Project Description  

Plan a design for a mobile app. Run through the guidelines taught during the week of Mobile Apps camp. Your work can be any type of document i.e. pdf, word doc, screen shots of drawings or wireframes, etc. 

Use the pdf file found in the [slides](https://github.com/techemstudios/mobile-app-development-project/tree/master/slides) directory to help visualize the objectives/requirements.  

Complete the [design sheet](https://github.com/techemstudios/mobile-app-development-project/blob/master/design_sheet/Mobile%20App%20Camp.docx) found in this repository.  

Check off the objectives below and upload your work to this repository. --See "Uploading Your Project Files" below.    

## Objectives  

* Define your goal
  - clearly define the purpose of the app
    - What is it going to do?
    - What makes it appealing?
    - Is there a problem that it's going to solve?
    - Will it mkae a person's life easier in some way? How?
    
**note** defining a clear goal will help the application reach its goal quicker.  

* Sketch the Interface  
  - Draw what the interface will look like
    - App Icon
    - Splash Screen  
    - Interface #1  
    - Interface #2  
  - This can be sketched on paper or via a drawing app, i.e. google drawing, paint, adobe, etc. (your choice)  
    
* Research
  - Are there other other apps that perform the same function?
  - Get inspired by other apps  
  
* Create a Wireframe & Storyboard  
  - Wireframe  
    - Create a mockup/prototype of your app using a site of your choice (there are several out there)  
    - This will bring your intial sketch more life  
    - The sites listed below all have a free trial available. If you are unable to export your wireframe, you can take screenshots of your work.  
    - Kinetise, Hotgloo, Basalmiq, Moqups  
    
  - Storyboard  
    - Create a road map of user possible user choices
    - You can use your initial sketch, add decisions to it; or, duplicate the intial sketch and add to it.
